# design-manufacturing-of-frame-for-fuel-cell

Overview
To design and manufacture the mechanical frame and mounts for the hydrogen fuel cell stack and its supporting electronics (PCBs), ensuring compact integration, serviceability, and structural safety within the vehicle.
Key Outcomes
Achieved a fully integrated, compact FC system with minimal weight penalty.
The vehicle passed all technical inspections and safety checks.
Contributed to the team winning 2nd place in Shell Eco-Marathon Europe 2025.
What I Did
Located the fuel cell bottle, control PCBs, and balance of plant components within the vehicle chassis.
Designed a modular frame structure that houses all FC electronics securely.
Created mounts and brackets for each subsystem (FC, sensors, PCB).
Carried out DFM (Design for Manufacturing) and fabricated components in-house.
Supported system integration and wiring before competition.
